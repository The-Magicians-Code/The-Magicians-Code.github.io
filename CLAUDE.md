# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Astro dev server at `http://localhost:4321/`
- `npm run build` — Production build into `dist/`
- `npm run check` — TypeScript + Astro diagnostics (`astro check`); the project's only static-analysis gate
- `npm run preview` — Preview the production build locally
- `npm run resume:pdf` — Generate `dist/Tanel_Treuberg_Software_Engineer.pdf` directly from `src/data/resume.ts` via `pdf-lib` (no browser; see Deployment → Resume PDF). Add `-- --copy-public` to also write the gitignored `public/Tanel_Treuberg_Software_Engineer.pdf` so the dev-server Export button resolves.
- `npm run resume:pdf:verify` — Poppler gate (`pdfinfo` + `pdftotext`) asserting the generated PDF is A4 and its text extracts in reading order. Needs `poppler-utils` installed.

There is no automated test suite. Verification on changes is `npm run check` + `npm run build` + manual browser checks. Do not claim "tests pass" — say so explicitly when verification is build-only.

## Debugging engine-specific visual bugs

When a visual or animation bug reproduces on one engine only (e.g. Safari/iOS but not Chromium), capture visual evidence **before** the first speculative fix — ask the user for a screen recording and inspect it frame-by-frame (ffmpeg montage / high-fps extraction). Code-reading cannot distinguish "size leads position" from "position leads size"; frames can. And never let a fix for one symptom silently change unrelated behavior (scroll position, focus state) — if it must, call it out.

Precedent: the bento card morph-jump ("expands right, then jumps to center", Safari/iOS only) was misdiagnosed three times — scroll-lock, `position:fixed` body lock, then removing the morph delay — before frame extraction from a user screen recording revealed the real cause was the card's `aspect-ratio` desyncing WebKit's `width`/`height` interpolation from `top`/`left`. Two of those wrong fixes also broke scroll position. See `memory/project_cover_parallax.md` for the full gotcha.

## Deployment

- GitHub Actions workflow at [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) runs on push to `main`. The `build` job is explicit (it does not use `withastro/action`): `checkout` → `setup-node` (Node 22, npm cache) → `configure-pages` → `npm ci` → `npm run build` → install `poppler-utils` → `npm run resume:pdf` → `npm run resume:pdf:verify` → `upload-pages-artifact (path: dist)`. The `deploy` job then runs `actions/deploy-pages@v5`. The PDF is generated (and verified) **between** build and artifact upload, so it ships inside the Pages artifact.
- Custom domain `themagicianscode.dev` is bound via repo Settings → Pages — read directly by `actions/deploy-pages`. There is intentionally no `public/CNAME`; do not re-add one.
- Workflow convention from recent history: feature branch → PR → `chatgpt-codex-connector` bot auto-reviews on PR open → merge with a merge commit + branch delete. Match that pattern; don't push directly to `main`.
- **Netlify (`netlify.toml`, project `earnest-gumdrop-996726`) is for dev-branch build previews only — NOT production.** Each PR gets a deploy preview at `https://deploy-preview-<PR#>--earnest-gumdrop-996726.netlify.app` that rebuilds on every push, used for remote testing (e.g. Safari/iOS parity on a real device). A green Netlify preview ≠ a prod deploy; **prod only updates when the branch merges to `main` and the Pages Action runs.**

### Resume PDF (build-time, ATS-minimal, deterministic)

- The PDF is generated at **build time**, not committed, and served at **`/Tanel_Treuberg_Software_Engineer.pdf`** (the filename doubles as the download name since GitHub Pages can't set `Content-Disposition`; `PDF_FILENAME` in [generate.ts](scripts/resume-pdf/generate.ts) is the source of truth — keep the button href, robots.txt, .gitignore and verify script in sync with it). It is a **bare-minimum, machine-readable (ATS) document built directly from `src/data/resume.ts`**. `generate.ts` (run via `tsx`) lays out a single-column, black-&-white A4 page with `pdf-lib` using the **base-14 Helvetica family (non-embedded)** → ~5 KB, fully copyable text, clickable `/Link` annotations (email + portfolio). The PDF is the only way the resume is served — there is no styled `/resume/` page; the nav **Resume** link (in [MorphNav.astro](src/components/MorphNav.astro), wired via the `links` prop in [BaseLayout.astro](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro) with `external: true`) renders as `<a href="/Tanel_Treuberg_Software_Engineer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">` (opens an inline preview, not a forced download). The PDF's `/Title` + `DisplayDocTitle` make viewers show that name (sans `.pdf`) in the tab.
- **No headless browser.** Chromium/Playwright/sirv were intentionally removed — `page.pdf()` always embeds font subsets (heavy) and risks ATS reading-order scrambling. Direct generation gives zero embedded fonts and clean linear text order.
- **Character policy:** [scripts/resume-pdf/sanitize.ts](scripts/resume-pdf/sanitize.ts) preserves all WinAnsi-renderable characters (Estonian letters `OÜ`/`INSÜK`, `°`, `×`, `·`, dashes, smart quotes) and normalizes only the genuinely non-renderable superscripts (`10⁻³` → `10^-3`). Every drawn string passes `normalizeForPdf` then `assertEncodable` (`font.encodeText`), which **throws (fails the build) on any un-encodable char** — never ships a silent "?".
- **Determinism:** no `Date.now()`/`Math.random()`; metadata dates derive from `resume.meta.updatedAt` (fixed UTC). Two runs produce byte-identical output. Single page is a soft target — the generator `console.warn`s (does not hard-fail) if content overflows to a 2nd page; tighten layout constants in `generate.ts` or trim content if so.
- **CI gate:** [scripts/verify-resume-pdf.mjs](scripts/verify-resume-pdf.mjs) runs poppler `pdfinfo` (A4 + page count) + `pdftotext` (key text present and in reading order) and fails the build on any miss.
- **Self-hosted fonts** ([src/styles/fonts.css](src/styles/fonts.css), woff2 in `public/fonts/`; no Google Fonts CDN) remain — they serve the live **website** only; the PDF does not use them.
- The PDF is disallowed in [public/robots.txt](public/robots.txt) (GitHub Pages can't set `X-Robots-Tag` on the static PDF).

## Liquid Glass Module

> **No longer the nav.** The production nav is now [MorphNav.astro](src/components/MorphNav.astro) (a morphing-pill nav on plain `backdrop-filter` glass). The old `Nav.astro` / `#nav-pill` Liquid Glass nav has been removed. This module still ships and is the most non-obvious system in the repo, but it now only renders on prototype/demo surfaces carrying `class="liquid-glass"` (e.g. [src/pages/musicplayer.astro](src/pages/musicplayer.astro), [src/pages/nav-test.astro](src/pages/nav-test.astro)).

The effect is a custom CSS+SVG+Canvas pipeline (Snell's-law refraction + specular highlight) that runs on Chromium and gracefully falls back on Safari/Firefox.

**Three layers, one signal:**

| Layer | File | Role |
|------|------|------|
| Pre-paint UA sniff | [src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro) (`<script is:inline>`) | Sets `html.lg-no-svg-backdrop` on Safari/Firefox before any styled HTML paints |
| Runtime | [src/scripts/liquid-glass.ts](src/scripts/liquid-glass.ts) | Discovers `.liquid-glass` elements on `DOMContentLoaded`, builds per-instance SVG `<filter>` chains, rasterizes displacement + specular PNGs via Canvas, sets `backdrop-filter` inline. Skips entirely if the html class is present. |
| Stylesheet | [src/styles/liquid-glass.css](src/styles/liquid-glass.css) + the `html.lg-no-svg-backdrop` block in [src/styles/global.css](src/styles/global.css) | Default `:root` token values, `.glass`-equivalent fallback rule, and the Safari/Firefox swap to mobile-icon-style frosted glass |

**Public API for new consumers:**

- Add `class="liquid-glass"` to any element. Eight CSS custom properties tune the effect: `--lg-thickness`, `--lg-bezel`, `--lg-ior`, `--lg-uniform-shift`, `--lg-blur`, `--lg-saturate`, `--lg-svg-saturate`, `--lg-spec-alpha`. They cascade via `getComputedStyle`, so set on a parent and descendants inherit.
- `data-lg-mobile` opts an element into the effect below the 641px breakpoint (default is desktop-only).
- `data-lg-tuner` mounts a dynamically-imported dev panel ([src/scripts/liquid-glass-tuner.ts](src/scripts/liquid-glass-tuner.ts)) targeting that element. One module tuner per page; subsequent ones are warned and ignored.
- Imperative: `window.__lg.refresh(el)` re-rasterizes after CSS-var changes. The runtime publishes this synchronously at script-eval time; consumers can guard with `window.__lg?.refresh?.(el)`.

**Why CSS @supports isn't enough:** Safari's parser accepts `url()` in `backdrop-filter` syntactically but doesn't render SVG filters that way. `@supports not ((backdrop-filter: url(#x)) or ...)` returns false on Safari → the rule never fires. The UA sniff in BaseLayout is the reliable signal; both the CSS fallback and the runtime gate read it.

**Design context:** [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-liquid-glass-module-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-liquid-glass-module-design.md) captures the architectural decisions, the codex-rescue review findings that shaped the spec (the original `var(--lg-filter, none)` chain was invalid CSS that would have dropped the whole declaration), explicit non-goals (no dynamic-mount support, no per-element filter cleanup on DOM removal), and acceptance criteria. Read this before refactoring the module.

**Tuning:** put `data-lg-tuner` (above) on a demo consumer to summon the module's sliders panel ([liquid-glass-tuner.ts](src/scripts/liquid-glass-tuner.ts)). The former `Nav.astro` nav-specific tuner (which wrote the eight vars to `#nav-pill` plus two nav-only knobs `glassBg`/`progBlur`) was removed along with the Liquid Glass nav; MorphNav has no such tuner.

## Content Collections

[src/content.config.ts](src/content.config.ts) defines two collections:

- `projects` — Markdown under [src/content/projects/](src/content/projects/) with `title`, `description`, `repoUrl`, `order` (int, used for sort), and `draft` (bool, filtered out). Rendered by [src/pages/projects/[slug].astro](src/pages/projects/%5Bslug%5D.astro) for detail pages and listed on the homepage via [src/components/ProjectsSection.astro](src/components/ProjectsSection.astro).
- `blog` — Markdown under [src/content/blog/](src/content/blog/) with `title`, `description`, `pubDate`, `draft`. No public route currently consumes this collection; it is wired but unused on the rendered site.

## Project Process Conventions

The `docs/superpowers/` folder retains the design specs and implementation plans for substantive features (the Astro migration and liquid-glass module). They are not built into `dist/` and do not affect the deployed site, but they are the "why" trail behind recent merges. Keep them current when revising the systems they describe — a stale spec is worse than no spec.

The user's global CLAUDE.md establishes a pre-implementation Codex review convention for any work introducing new logic or new integrations: hand the plan to `codex:codex-rescue` before touching code, apply feedback you agree with, then implement. Skip only for one-line config flips, comment-only fixes, typo fixes, doc updates, or pinpointed mechanical bugfixes.
